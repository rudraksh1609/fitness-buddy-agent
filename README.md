Fitness Buddy – IBM Summer Intership Project by Edunet by Rudraksh Agarwal

Problem Statement
The challenge - In today’s fast-paced world, many individuals struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due 
to lack of personalized guidance, time constraints, and inconsistent motivation. Traditional fitness 
solutions often require expensive subscriptions, in-person consultations, or rigid schedules that don't 
adapt to personal preferences or daily routines. 
There is a growing need for an accessible, friendly, and intelligent virtual assistant that can provide on
demand fitness advice, healthy lifestyle suggestions, and basic nutrition guidance—all tailored to 
individual needs and available at any time. 
Fitness Buddy aims to solve this problem by offering a conversational, AI-powered health and fitness 
coach that can:
Recommend home workouts and routines based on user input. 
1. Provide motivational tips and daily fitness inspiration. 
2. Suggest simple, nutritious meal ideas. 
3. Encourage habit-building and consistency. 
Technology: Use of IBM cloud lite services /IBM Granity is mandatory.
